  {name = 'Armor overall', OQ = 2, SR = 1, MA = 0.5, UT = 0.5}, --OQ is half of all armor stats, sr is a quater(regular and special resist), and the last quater is half ma and ut
  {name = 'Armor resists', OQ = 0.5, SR = 0.5},
  {name = 'Food overall', DR = 1, OQ = 0.91, PE = 1.42, FL = 0.67}, --66 and 33 are split to 67 and 33
  {name = 'Food length', FL = 0.67, OQ = 0.33},
  {name = 'Food strength', OQ = 0.33, PE = 0.67},
